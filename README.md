# scc2020

Mirror of the repository for the UT Austin virtual student cluster competition 2020 team at the SC20 conference.
Placed 6th overall in the competition (out of 19 universities).

Each directory contains miscellaneous competition items, i.e. build software, push results, notes, etc.
I worked primarily on the Gromacs molecular dynamics application, but also contributed to the Azure CycleCloud configuration templates and general cluster setup scripts.
