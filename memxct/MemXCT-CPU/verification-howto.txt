--- How to open the .bin files in Fiji ---

- Intro -
Fiji does not have an extensive CLI, so the only option left is to run the
executable on the TACC machine (you should probably not run it on a login node
to be safe). Make sure you have X11 forwarding setup so you can see the
output, otherwise Fiji will very likely throw an error.

- Running Fiji -
To run Fiji, simply go to the Fiji.app directory and run the ImageJ-linux64
executable. Make sure to not put a filename as a command line argument,
otherwise it will try to recognize the binary as an image formart like .png,
.bmp, or something else.

- Opening the Image -
In Fiji, go to the top left corner and select File -> Import -> Raw. There,
open the .bin file you want to preview. Make the Image type 32-bit Real.
Set the width and height according to the readme.md file in this directory.
Next, check the box for Little-endian byte order. Leave all other values at
their default value and open it. The image should match the images on the
readme.
