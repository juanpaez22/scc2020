The material here is for a basic introduction to mpi.
There is the current directory you're in and a "solution" directory. 
The current directory has a basic hello world mpi program along with a summation program demonstrating the MPI_Reduce call.
-Inspect the source files and compile the code you can run it with mpi. 
The solution directory has the correct mpi calls for pi.c and ppi.c.
-Inspect those two source files in the solution folder and compile so you can run them.
There is also a job script in the solution folder which you can use if you want to submit the job through sbatch.  

*Suggestion(s)
1. The myJob.sh sbatch script won't work for you initially. I left it as is from when I was testing things. You will need to change some of the sbatch directives. Review the stampede2 user guide for info on submitting jobs with an sbatch script.
2. It's always a good idea to have a second window open so you can view what your job is doing. Instead of always having to create a new ssh session you can use something like tmux or screen to open new windows and maintain persistant ssh connections. 
3. You can change the value of the variable "n" in pi.c and ppi.c to reflect M (10^6) and G (10^9).  

*Note(s)
1. You can use whatever compiler you want to compile the programs. However, there are only two available on stampede2. 
2. When compiling an mpi program be sure to use the appropiate compiler wrapper.
3. When launching mpi programs you'll need to use an mpi launcher. Hint: ibrun is what we use at tacc
4. Don't get too bogged down on the code. Remember this is not a coding competition. Focsus on learning how to run programs on HPC machines and understand the hardware, software, and architecture.
